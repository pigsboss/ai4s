The context also mentions that at a 10 m baseline, only certain constraints like C2 are active, which probably means they impose specific limits on how the interferometer can operate.\n",

It says that for missions longer than 367 years, the propellant mass fraction becomes a concern, but that's beyond reasonable mission lengths. So, while this isn't a current limit, it shows that fuel constraints could affect long-term operations.\n",

These all relate to the physical integrity and stability of the spacecraft, which are crucial for maintaining the interferometer's functionality.\n",

The critical time curve in Figure 5-42 has a steep slope because the propellant mass rates are small. It also mentions that even though MSI's propellant rate is higher than SCI's, the absolute magnitude is so small that it would take a long time for the extra propellant needed for MSI to equal the extra structural mass of SCI.\n",

      "Looking at Figure 5-18, it discusses constraints like dry mass (Cl), frequency (C2), and minimum gage (C5).

This implies that structurally connected systems might have different design considerations than separated ones.\n",

      "Putting this together, I think the main differences lie in how the spacecraft are connected. A structurally connected interferometer (SCI) likely has all components attached to a single structure, which would mean less need for propulsion since they don't have to maintain formation by themselves. This could lead to lower propellant mass rates but might require more structural mass to keep everything rigid and stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, a separated or multiple spacecraft interferometer (MSI) involves individual spacecraft that are not physically connected. They must use thrusters to maintain their positions relative to each other, which increases the need for propellant. However, this setup might offer more flexibility in deployment and scaling, especially over longer baselines where a single structure wouldn't be feasible.\n",

      "The context also mentions that for very long missions (over 367 years), MSI's propellant mass fraction exceeds 30%, but such mission lengths are beyond typical practical ranges.
